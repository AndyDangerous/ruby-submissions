### DenverParks

#### Pitch

Discover all the amazing things near any address in Denver.

#### Description

The front range has some amazing resources, but how should you find them? Enter an address and find out the distance to all the [parks and open spaces](http://gis.drcog.org/datacatalog/content/open-space-2013) within walking (one mile), casual biking (five miles), and gnarlier bike ride (25 miles) distances. You will be able to sort parks by size and amenities (park vs. open space, dog friendly, etc.) as well. Then get directions to the park of your choice.


#### Target Audience

People on the front range looking to recreate

#### Integrations

* This project lends itself to using google as an OAuth provider because google, but also mapmyfitness, fitbit, ~~and github~~
* DRCOG's open space map
* Probably Mapquest (based on OSM) for the routing
* OSM map tiles
