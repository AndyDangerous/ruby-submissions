### AdventureBlogger

#### Pitch

You already map your adventures, now share them.

#### Description

Everyone has a GPS tool, and we bring them on our adventures. Now, instead of showing STRAVA-esque maps to stroke your ego or picture-filled TRs on TGR, combine both (with your picutes, of course) to tell your story.

* Upload a gpx (or some other format) GPS track to the app
* Upload any pictures you took along the way
* Tell your story in a rich text editor
* Share your post with the world
* ~~Profit~~

#### Target Audience

##### Content Creators:
* People who go on adventures and like to post trip reports. This varies from dentists on $10k road bikes going to golden for coffee to dirtbag climbers looking for (and getting) sponsorships from gear companies. The middle ground are people who want to share their stories with their family/friends and be able to look back.  

##### Content Consumers:
* People who read outside magazine
* People looking for beta on a trip they'd like to do


#### Integrations

* This project lends itself to using google as an OAuth provider because google
* I'm not sure which Data.gov data would make sense for this project
* There would need to be several integrations:
  * The usual social media stuff
  * OpenStreetMap tiles for the maps
  * Mapquest or other service for geocoding and directions to adventures
