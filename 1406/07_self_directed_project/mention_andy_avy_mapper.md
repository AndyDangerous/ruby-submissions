### AvyMapper

#### Pitch

An open source for user-contributed avalanche observation and analysis

#### Description

The [Colorado Avalanche Information Center](http://avalanche.state.co.us/) maintains a database of avalanche observations, but there isn't much of a spatial component to it.  Users would be able to view avalanches around the state and query the database to learn more about patterns in avalanches over time and space. This type of tool is currently only available to some researchers. It would provide registered users with the ability to create new avalanche observations (e.g. http://avalanche.state.co.us/observations/submit-a-report/, but also including a spatial component or taking one from a cell phone picture with GPS coordinates)

#### Target Audience

There are two main groups that would benefit from an app like this:
* The avalanche professionals who ___
* Backcountry skiers who may want to submit reports, but also want to see what is happening and where
* CDOT needs to keep the roads safe and open to traffic.

#### Integrations

* This project lends itself to using google as an OAuth provider because google
* I'm not sure which Data.gov data would make sense for this project
* There would need to be several integrations:
  * OpenStreetMap tiles for the maps
  * Mapquest or other service for geocoding
